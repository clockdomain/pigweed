# ARMv7-M Support Documentation

This directory collects design and status documentation for ARMv7-M (Cortex-M3/M4, PMSAv7) support in `pw_kernel`.

## Documents

- **Implementation summary:**
  - [SUMMARY_ARMv7-M_Support.md](../../SUMMARY_ARMv7-M_Support.md)
- **Userspace & MPU design (current plan):**
  - [DESIGN_ARMv7M_Userspace_Support.md](../../DESIGN_ARMv7M_Userspace_Support.md)
- **Work order / task tracking:**
  - [tasks.md](tasks.md)

Over time, new target-specific docs (e.g. `ast1030.md`, `armv7m_minimal.md`) and deeper design notes can be added under this directory.
