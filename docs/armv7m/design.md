# ARMv7-M Userspace & MPU Support – Design

This file anchors the design for the ARMv7-M userspace & MPU support work order.

The primary, detailed design lives in:

- [DESIGN_ARMv7M_Userspace_Support.md](../../DESIGN_ARMv7M_Userspace_Support.md)

Use that file for the full architectural description, constraints, and migration plan. This wrapper exists so tools and humans can consistently find the "design" for the ARMv7-M work under `docs/armv7m/`.
